title: What do doctors know? 
---

In the last post I worked on establishing a roadmap of medicine by browsing Wikipedia's outline of medicine and looking at online med school syllabi. Another avenue I tried was reaching out to one of my most excellent homies, a true life med student, to ask what he learned during the first years of his program. Based on his amazingly helpful answer and a bit of other content I found web searching, in this post I'll try to list the basic sciences taught to doctors. My hope is that this will be helpful not only for giving an overview of what is known in medicine, but also for communicating with clinicians - a skill I could really benefit from as a patient. 

## Med School

My medical pal confirmed that during the first two of the four years of traditional med school, instruction is focused on basic science, and that instruction in clinical practices is reserved for the 3rd and 4rth years. The first year covers normal physiology while the second year covers pathology. The metric of a student's success during these two years is her score on the [USMLE Step 1 Exam](http://www.usmle.org/step-1/), so the content of that exam is pretty much all you need to get a sense of what med students are jamming into their brains during that two years. It seems like a pretty standard resource for studying for the test is the [First Aid book on the subject](http://www.amazon.com/First-Aid-USMLE-Step-2015/dp/0071840060). 

This is great for me, because it means I can pretty much ignore everything else and just check out that First Aid book. In the rest of this post, I'll read over the main topics covered in that book, and add in anything my med student amigo mentioned that he studied that wasn't in the book.

### Biochemistry
<!--- From Ben: basics (just basics) of 
    -cellular cytoskeleton
    -cellular metabolism, and the pathways for recycling important molecules like ammonia.

#### Molecular

* Chromatin structure and function: how DNA, RNA, and proteins are are bound together and function inside of a cell.
* Nucleotides: the building blocks of nucleic acids like DNA and RNA.
* Synthesis of the nucleotides purine and pyramidine: important in part because various drugs work by inhibiting this synthesis.
* Purine salvage deficiencies: Some diseases are caused by this.
* DNA replication
* DNA mutations
* Lac operon: an operon is a cluster of DNA that is transcribed as a package. Glucose and lactose levels determine the degree to which this operon is transcribed. This illustrates the effect the environment can have on gene function. 
* DNA repair
* DNA/RNA/protein synthesis direction: These things have a directionality, and apparently it's important what direction they're transribed in.
* Start and stop codons: specific sequences of nuclei that code for starting and stopping transcription
* Functional organization of the eukaryotic gene: Locations of important components of a gene. 
* Regulation of gene expression: Promoters, enhancers, and silencers
* RNA polymerases: enzymes that synthesize RNA during replication
* Introns vs exons
* tRNA: type of RNA that helps decode an mRNA molecule
* Post-translational modifications: trimming  and adding 
* Protein synthesis: initiation, elongation, termination
* Protein folding
* Chaperone protein: intracellular protein that facilitates protein folding

#### Cellular

* Cell cycle: series of events that occur leading up to the division and duplication of a cell
* Rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulums: different types of things happen at these sites.
* Cell trafficking: how different things move around inside of a cell
* Proteasomes and peroxisomes: catabolize proteins and fats inside of a cell
* Cytoskeleton: network of protein fibers inside of a cell that support organelle movement, cell division, and cell structure. 
* Immunohistochemical stains: various stains for cells such as connective tissue, muscles, and neurons. 
* Microtubules: a component of the cytoskeleton found throughout the cytoplasm. There are some drugs that act on microtubules.
* Plasma membrane composition
* Sodium potassium pump
* Collagen: protein that makes up much of the body. There are several types of it, and defects in the different types cause different ailments. Some information about its synthesis and structure are important.
* Elastin: another important protein that makes up organs such as skin and lungs. 

#### Lab Techniques
* Polymer chain reaction: amplifies desired fragments of DNA. The amplified fragments can be used as a diagnostic tool
* Gel electrophoresis: technique for separating macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins)
* Blotting: transferring biological samples from a gel to a membrane then identifying the contents of samples on the membrane
* Western blotting: using antibodies that bind to specific proteins in order to identify proteins in a blot
* Southern blotting: using a DNA probe - which binds to a specific DNA sequence and lights up - to identify DNA sequences in a blot
* Northern blot: like the southern blot but for RNA
* Southwestern blot: detects proteins that bind to DNA
* Microarrays:
