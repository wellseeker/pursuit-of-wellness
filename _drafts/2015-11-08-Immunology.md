title: Immunology from 10 Thousand Feet 
---

A lot of the commonly discusses disorders with symptoms similar to mine are autoimmune in nature, so I'm going to start with that field.

-immunology started with the observation that exposure to cowpox prevented smallpox, inhalation of dried crusts of smallpox pustules prevent smallpox (how did they discover that??), greeks observed that people who had been sick with a plague didn't recatch it.

-pasteur showed that attenuated pathogen's caused later doses of the same pathogen to not kill sheep.

-turn of 20th century it was shown that transferring blood serum from one animal to another transferred the immunity.

-gamma globulin, now called immunoglobulin, was shown to be responsible (not explained how it was found).

-in 1883 metchnikoff observed that certain white blood cells, which he called phagocytes, were able to ingest foreign microorganisms and other foreign material.

-"It was difficult to study the activities of immune cells before the development of modern tissue culture techniques"
    -I wonder what modern tissue culture techniques he means

-In 1940, Chase succeeded in transferring white blood cells to transfer immunity.

-In 1950, the "lymphocyte" was identified as the cell responsible for both cellular and humoral immunity transfer.

-Soon after, someone found two types of lymphocyes, T and B (in chickens). 

-antibodies are molecules that are attached to the outside of cells. They bind to foreign material ie antigens.

-the "clonal selection theory" is the modern view of immunity.

What exactly is inflammation??
    -probably worth another blog post
    -section on page 8 of this chapter covers it.

Another blog post: chronic fatigue syndrome

    -this review article is excellent, and I should return to it: http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.princeton.edu/science/article/pii/S1386653206003088
    -are there any prominent CFS researchers nearby? could I get an office visit? are there any who i might establish an email relationship with.

What about chronic pain syndrome?
    -http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.princeton.edu/science/article/pii/S1386653206003088 (from 1980's)
    -http://www.iasp-pain.org/files/Content/ContentFolders/Publications2/FreeBooks/Classification-of-Chronic-Pain.pdf (from the 19990's)
    -abstract from a poster session (i think) http://www.neurology.org/content/84/14_Supplement/P5.055.short
    -mildly potentially interesting, but i couldn't get the full text http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/19668291
    -this looks great, but I couldn't find it anywhere Immune Abnormalities in Chronic Pain Syndrome (CPS) With Unknown Etiology

Maybe I should do a blog post on diybio.

Gastrointestinal: I should read into what problems can happen if nutrients are absorbed, and issues with detecting malabsorption.

In blog post on what do doctors know, talk about usmle step tests, need to be in med school.

Topics covered on the rheumatology board exam: http://www.abim.org/pdf/blueprint/rheu_cert.pdf.
