What do genetic counselors - the people with an MS - know and do?

What do medical geneticists - the people with and MD - know and do?

Difference between genotyping and sequencing [explained](https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/202904600-What-is-the-difference-between-genotyping-and-sequencing-).

This company actually has a [product](https://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/clinical/datasheet-trugenome-undiagnosed-disease.pdf) marketed to people with undiagnosed diseases. When you purchase this product they sequence your whole genome, and possibly also your parents' genomes, then test it for a bunch of diseases. If [this](http://www.illumina.com/clinical/illumina_clinical_laboratory/trugenome-clinical-sequencing-services.html) page refers to the same test, which I think it does, then the single person genome test is currently $9,500.

This is an interesint looking [resource](https://precisionmedicine.duke.edu/researchers/precision-medicine-programs/clinical-whole-genome-sequencing).

This page shows information about a bunch of labs' whole genome sequencing products. The product I looked at in some detail was designed for research purpose only.

This [product](https://www.genebygene.com/pages/research?goto=exome-sequencing) offers whole exome sequencing (WES) for $1,095. The same company's whole genome sequencing (WGS) [product](https://www.genebygene.com/pages/research?goto=exome-sequencing) is $10,395.

Are there useful tests other than WGS and WES that would be less expensive?

I've seen the acronym RUO when looking at this stuff, I think it stands for "research use only".
