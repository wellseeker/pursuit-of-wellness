title: Autoantibody Assays 
---

### What are autoantibodies?
An antibody produced by an organism's B cells that is directed at the organism's own proteins[^aab_wikipedia]. [Here](https://neuroendoimmune.wordpress.com/2013/04/16/horror-autotoxicus-the-story-of-autoimmunity/)'s a nice laymen's summary of autoimmune disorders[^neuroimmune_company_note]. It includes a very handy list of autoimmune markers for which lab assays exist. 

### What are some important assay techniques?

Early immunoassays were

* indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)
* immunodiffusion
* hemagglutination
* complement fixation

Most of these were used historically, IIF is the only one widely used today[^chap_77]. Other more modern techniques are 

* immunoblotting
* expression cloning
* DNA sequencing

Some modern antigen-specific immunoassays are

* enzyme linked immunoassays
* dot blots
* line immunoassays
* addressable laser bead immunoassays
* chemiluminescence

Emerging technologies are

* lateral flow
* antigen arrays on planar surfaces
* nanobarcodes

### What kinds of tests are normally ordered for muscle/joint pain and fatigue?

Guessing from what the doctors I've seen have done, if a doctor suspects an autoimmune disorder[^list_of_ai_diseases], they'll order some subset of 

* ANA screen by indirect fluorescent antibody
* Rheumatoid factor by immunoturbidimetry, e.g. [Quest's](http://www.questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/TestDetail.action?ntc=4418)
* C-reactive protein by [nephelometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephelometry_(medicine)), e.g. [Quest's](http://www.questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/BUOrderInfo.action?tc=4420&labCode=DAL)
* Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate a.k.a. Sed Rate. This test measures the rate at which red blood settle in a pipette. This can be taken as an indication of general inflammation, because when an inflammatory process is present a pro-sedimentation factor called fibrinogen is present in the blood in a high proportion to other anti-sedimentation factors called erythrocytes.

A doc might also check uric acid levels if joint pain is notably strong and will probably also do a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC seems to be something every doc wants to do whenever they order anything else.

Some assays that look for inflammation that is specifically related to Celiac's disease are

* tissue transglutaminase
* immunoglobulin A 
* gliadin

Other less common tests that may be ordered in the presence of muscle and joint pain are

* aldolase, an enzyme the levels of which may be elevated in the presence of muscle damage
* HLA-B27, that is, human leukocyte antigen B-27. I guess this is some specific white blood cell antigen. It's thought to be present in ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile arthritis, and reactive arthritis[^hla-b27-page]
* creatine kinase, another enzyme which may be at elevated levels in the presence of muscle damage.

Sensitivity and specifity are important properties by which different assay methods are judged.
