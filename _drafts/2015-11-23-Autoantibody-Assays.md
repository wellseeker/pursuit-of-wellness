title: Autoantibody Assays 
---

It has been documented that some disease-specific antibodies (aab) predate the characteristic symptoms of the disease by many years[^chap_77]. This is an exciting prospect if you have troublesome but non-specific symptoms and and suspect an emerging/subclinical disease - perhaps antibody testing could lead to expedited diagnosis and treatment. Aab are also used alongside clinical features to classify autoimmune disorders, so it's very much worth understanding a bit about them. In this post I'll learn some basic things about autoantibodies and assays for their presence.

### What are autoantibodies?
An antibody produced by an organism's B cells that is directed at the organism's own proteins[^aab_wikipedia]. [Here](https://neuroendoimmune.wordpress.com/2013/04/16/horror-autotoxicus-the-story-of-autoimmunity/)'s a nice laymen's summary of autoimmune disorders[^neuroimmune_company_note]. It includes a very handy list of autoimmune markers for which lab assays exist. 

### Currently measurable autoantibodies implicated in diseases
Todo: Add content from the Bizzaro paper here. When going through the paper, use it's content to document the impression I've been getting that although there's research on aab antibodies, the diagnostic role is only well established for some diseases I don't have the clinical presentation of, and for some of them my current blood work screens me out of the diagnosis. Or maybe that's wrong, will see when trying to document it. 

### What kinds of tests are normally ordered for muscle/joint pain and fatigue?

Guessing from what the doctors I've seen have done, if a doctor suspects an autoimmune disorder[^list_of_ai_diseases], they'll order some subset of 

* ANA screen by indirect fluorescent antibody
* Rheumatoid factor by immunoturbidimetry, e.g. [Quest's](http://www.questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/TestDetail.action?ntc=4418)
* C-reactive protein by [nephelometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephelometry_(medicine)), e.g. [Quest's](http://www.questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/BUOrderInfo.action?tc=4420&labCode=DAL)
* Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate a.k.a. Sed Rate. This test measures the rate at which red blood settle in a pipette. This can be taken as an indication of general inflammation, because when an inflammatory process is present a pro-sedimentation factor called fibrinogen is present in the blood in a high proportion to other anti-sedimentation factors called erythrocytes.

A doc might also check uric acid levels if joint pain is notably strong and will probably also do a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC seems to be something every doc wants to do whenever they order anything else.

Some assays that look for inflammation that is specifically related to Celiac's disease are

* tissue transglutaminase
* immunoglobulin A 
* gliadin

Other less common tests that may be ordered in the presence of muscle and joint pain are

* aldolase, an enzyme the levels of which may be elevated in the presence of muscle damage
* HLA-B27, that is, human leukocyte antigen B-27. I guess this is some specific white blood cell antigen. It's thought to be present in ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile arthritis, and reactive arthritis[^hla-b27-page]
* creatine kinase, another enzyme which may be at elevated levels in the presence of muscle damage.

Another common set of serological (blood serum) tests I've seen is the immunoglobulin panel. [This post]({% post_url 2015-12-18-Useful-Basic-Biology %}) has some basic info for understanding immunoglobulins. In the panel I've seen quantity of IgA, IgG, and IgM in a unit of blood were measured. Immunoglobulins may be elevated or decreased in a variety of scenarios in which the immune system is not functioning properly. As a result these tests are not alone diagnostic of any specific disorder, but can be suggestive in the presence of other lab findings or clinical features[^labtestsonline_immunoglobulins]. A list of situations in which each of these immunoglobulins may be elevated or decreased can be found [here](https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/immunoglobulins/tab/test/). 

### Todo

* Go through this paper, adding it's relevant content to blog: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22708/epdf
* Read rest of chapter
* Decide what to do next in regard to examining auto-antibody assays 

Sensitivity and specifity are important properties by which different assay methods are judged.
This[^fritzler_aab_review_2008] paper gives a nice overview of the state of the research and practice of aab for detecting pre-clinical autoimmune diseases.

### Take aways 
* There are some aab associated with diseases, but it's mostly SLE that's been studied 


### List of assay methods 

Early immunoassays were

* indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)
* immunodiffusion
* hemagglutination
* complement fixation

Most of these were used historically, IIF is the only one widely used today[^chap_77]. Other more modern techniques are 

* immunoblotting
* expression cloning
* DNA sequencing

Some modern antigen-specific immunoassays are

* enzyme linked immunoassays
* dot blots
* line immunoassays
* addressable laser bead immunoassays
* chemiluminescence

Emerging technologies are

* lateral flow
* antigen arrays on planar surfaces
* nanobarcodes
