title: Autoantibody Assays 
---

It has been documented that some disease-specific antibodies (aab) predate the characteristic symptoms of the disease by many years[^chap_77]. This is an exciting prospect if you have troublesome but non-specific symptoms and and suspect an emerging/subclinical disease - perhaps antibody testing could lead to expedited diagnosis and treatment. Aab are also used alongside clinical features to classify autoimmune disorders, so it's very much worth understanding a bit about them. In this post I'll learn some basic things about autoantibodies and assays for their presence.

### What are autoantibodies?
An antibody produced by an organism's B cells that is directed at the organism's own proteins[^aab_wikipedia]. [Here](https://neuroendoimmune.wordpress.com/2013/04/16/horror-autotoxicus-the-story-of-autoimmunity/)'s a nice laymen's summary of autoimmune disorders[^neuroimmune_company_note]. It includes a very handy list of autoimmune markers for which lab assays exist. 

### Currently measurable autoantibodies implicated in diseases
To investigate this, I started from a [review by Nicola Bizzaro and colleagues](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22708/epdf), which seems to be appropriately broad in scope. However it's a little older than I'd prefer, c. 2007. If any of the information I find there is outdates, hopefully I'll catch it when reviewing other papers.

The review focuses on autoimmune rheumatic disorders (ARDs), which include

* RA  rheumatoid arthritis
* SLE systemic lupus erythematosus
* APS antiphospholipid syndrome
* CTD connective tissue disease
* SSc systemic sclerosis
* SS Sjogren's syndrome
* ...and possibly others

They say that it's still uncertain whether the presence of antibodies seen in the presence of ARDs are pathological. However, these antibodies have been shown to be predictive of overt ARD in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic patients. Unfortunately they don't give citations for this. The indicative nature of these antibodies is exciting because, along with the advent of microarray technologies that enable the simultaneous assay of hundreds of antibodies, we may be able to predict overt ARDs. 

Bizzaro and colleagues begin by discussing ANA, which has been implicated in association with SLE. Specifically, in the 1970's it was shown that antibodies to double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) were predictive of SLE. They also mention a bunch of other aab's found to be predictive of SLE

* Anti-Ro
* Anti-La 
* Anti-Sm
* Anti-RNP
* Anticardiolipin

Anti-Ro and anti-la are predictive or Sjogren's syndrome.

Rheumatoid factor (RF) is predictive of rheumatoid arthritis (unsurprisingly...). Antiâ€“cycliccitrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) is also used to predict RA. [Here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17434910)'s a nice paper on anti-CCP. I didn't see anything in the abstract that led me to believe that anti-CCP might be diagnostically useful in the presence of a negative RF, but I didn't completely rule that out from what I read.


Todo: Add content from the Bizzaro paper here. When going through the paper, use it's content to document the impression I've been getting that although there's research on aab antibodies, the diagnostic role is only well established for some diseases I don't have the clinical presentation of, and for some of them my current blood work screens me out of the diagnosis. Or maybe that's wrong, will see when trying to document it. 



### What kinds of tests are normally ordered for muscle/joint pain and fatigue?

Guessing from what the doctors I've seen have done, if a doctor suspects an autoimmune disorder[^list_of_ai_diseases], they'll order some subset of 

* ANA screen by indirect fluorescent antibody
* Rheumatoid factor by immunoturbidimetry, e.g. [Quest's](http://www.questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/TestDetail.action?ntc=4418)
* C-reactive protein by [nephelometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephelometry_(medicine)), e.g. [Quest's](http://www.questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/BUOrderInfo.action?tc=4420&labCode=DAL)
* Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate a.k.a. Sed Rate. This test measures the rate at which red blood settle in a pipette. This can be taken as an indication of general inflammation, because when an inflammatory process is present a pro-sedimentation factor called fibrinogen is present in the blood in a high proportion to other anti-sedimentation factors called erythrocytes.

A doc might also check uric acid levels if joint pain is notably strong and will probably also do a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC seems to be something every doc wants to do whenever they order anything else.

Some assays that look for inflammation that is specifically related to Celiac's disease are

* tissue transglutaminase
* immunoglobulin A 
* gliadin

Other less common tests that may be ordered in the presence of muscle and joint pain are

* aldolase, an enzyme the levels of which may be elevated in the presence of muscle damage
* HLA-B27, that is, human leukocyte antigen B-27. I guess this is some specific white blood cell antigen. It's thought to be present in ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile arthritis, and reactive arthritis[^hla-b27-page]
* creatine kinase, another enzyme which may be at elevated levels in the presence of muscle damage.

Another common set of serological (blood serum) tests I've seen is the immunoglobulin panel. [This post]({% post_url 2015-12-18-Useful-Basic-Biology %}) has some basic info for understanding immunoglobulins. In the panel I've seen quantity of IgA, IgG, and IgM in a unit of blood were measured. Immunoglobulins may be elevated or decreased in a variety of scenarios in which the immune system is not functioning properly. As a result these tests are not alone diagnostic of any specific disorder, but can be suggestive in the presence of other lab findings or clinical features[^labtestsonline_immunoglobulins]. A list of situations in which each of these immunoglobulins may be elevated or decreased can be found [here](https://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/immunoglobulins/tab/test/). 

## Usage and Interpretation of the Preceding aab Tests

In the rest of this post, I'll dig into the most recent information I can find about the aab tests I've seen doctors use for my case. 

### Anti Nuclear Antibody 

  * [This](http://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2010/05/25/ard.2009.127100.short) paper looks relevant, but I'll need to contact someone at the library to try to get it. 
  * Look at [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1717342/pdf/v077p00299.pdf) article for basic info on IF ANA tests.
  * [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1717342/pdf/v077p00299.pdf) says in its abstract conclusion that a negative IF ANA test makes a diagnosis of SLE or mixed connective tissue disease extremely unlikely. 
  * Seemingly in counterpoint to the last paper, [this paper](http://www.jrheum.org/content/35/10/1994.short) found that normal ANA titers are common in SLE.
  * [This paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/acr.21930/asset/21930_ftp.pdf?v=1&t=iinktc2t&s=0a1fdb6c9b64ec45f52dfd58913a90f986763514) did some kind of lit review plus asking rheum docs what they thought, and came up with a list of recommendations. One of their recommendations was to not test ANA subserologies without a positive ANA and clinical suspicion, with some exceptions. It also recommends not screening even generic ANA's in patients with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and myalgia or in patients with fibromyalgia. I'm not sure what to make of the methodology of this paper, so I wouldn't take this recommendation seriously at this point. 

### SED Rate, C-Reactive Protein, and Rheumatoid Factor
  * [This study](I_need_to_fix_this_link) found that a surprisingly high proportion of rheumatoid arthritis patients did not have abnormal CRP, SED rate, or rheumatoid factor.
  * [This](http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/97/5/303) paper concludes that seronegative lupus appears to be an extremely rare event.
  * [This](http://www.jrheum.org/content/36/8/1568.full) seems to be some kind of opinion paper that argues against current practices in regard to SED rate and CRP.

## Todo

* Look for papers about the interpretation of other aab tests I've had done, and look for aab's that can be missed by that set of tests.  

* Go through [this paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.22708/epdf), adding its relevant content to blog. 

## Take Aways 


### Miscellaneous Notes

* Indirect fluorescent antibody may be the same thing as indirect immunofluorescence.
* Sensitivity and specifity are important properties by which different assay methods are judged.
This[^fritzler_aab_review_2008] paper gives a nice overview of the state of the research and practice of aab for detecting pre-clinical autoimmune diseases.


### List of assay methods 

Early immunoassays were

* indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)
* immunodiffusion
* hemagglutination
* complement fixation

Most of these were used historically, IIF is the only one widely used today[^chap_77]. Other more modern techniques are 

* immunoblotting
* expression cloning
* DNA sequencing

Some modern antigen-specific immunoassays are

* enzyme linked immunoassays
* dot blots
* line immunoassays
* addressable laser bead immunoassays
* chemiluminescence

Emerging technologies are

* lateral flow
* antigen arrays on planar surfaces
* nanobarcodes
