title: Commonly Confused with CFS 
---

Here there's a big list of diagnoses that might be in a differential with CFS. I think this could be really useful as a list of diseases to look for case studies of unusual presentations. AFAIK I don't exactly fit any of these diseases, or CFS for that matter, so I'll need to look for case studies of unusual presentations - or wait for more symptoms to occur.
