title: Commonly Confused with CFS 
---

[Here](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mixed-connective-tissue-disease/basics/definition/CON-20026515?p=1) there's a big list of diagnoses that might be in a differential with CFS. It seems like a good idea for anyone with CFS or CFS-like to symptoms to look through these diseases to consider whether their case may be an usual presentation of one of them. Another route to a more specific diagnosis might be to look for case studies of unusual presentations of disorders in a list such as this. 

Another source of diseases like this is the exclusions list for a [research study](http://www.nova.edu/nim/study-of-me-cfs-in-men.html) on CFS I'm considering participating in.

> Exclusions:  Exclude active disease processes that explain most of the major symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, and cognitive dysfunction.  It is essential to exclude certain diseases, which would be  tragic  to  miss:  Addison’s  disease,  Cushing’s  Syndrome,  hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism,  iron deficiency, other treatable forms of anemia, iron overload syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cancer.  It is also  essential  to  exclude  treatable  sleep  disorders  such  as  upper  airway  resistance  syndrome  and obstructive  or  central  sleep  apnea;  rheumatological  disorders  such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis,  lupus, polymyositis and polymyalgia rheumatica; immune disorders such as AIDS; neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinsonism, myasthenia gravis and B12 deficiency; infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, chronic hepatitis, Lyme disease, etc.; primary psychiatric disorders and substance abuse. Exclusion of other diagnoses, which cannot be reasonably excluded by the patient’s history and physical examination, is achieved by laboratory testing and imaging. If a potentially confounding medical condition is under control, then the diagnosis of ME/CFS can be entertained if patients meet the criteria otherwise.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus
Joint pain with swelling is a common symptom[^medline], as is fatigue. A textbook listed dsDNA, Sm(u2-U4-6 RNP), U1, and a bunch of others, while medline had a much shorter and different list[^medline][^chap_77]. I'm not sure what to make of that. Just as a sidenote, even [dogs can get SLE](http://www.canismajor.com/dog/autoimmn.html).

### Mixed Connective Tissue Disease
From [this](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mixed-connective-tissue-disease/basics/definition/CON-20026515?p=1) description it sounds like a possible stretch for clinical presentation of a case like mine. One lab test for it looks for presence of the autoantibody U1RNP[^medline]. This is confirmed on [this](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/334482-workup) medline page (assuming undifferentiated connective tissue disease and mixed connective tissue disease are the same thing).
