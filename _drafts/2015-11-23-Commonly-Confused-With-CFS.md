title: Commonly Confused with CFS 
---

[Here](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mixed-connective-tissue-disease/basics/definition/CON-20026515?p=1) there's a big list of diagnoses that might be in a differential with CFS. It seems like a good idea for anyone with CFS or CFS-like to symptoms to look through these diseases to consider whether their case may be an usual presentation of one of them. Another route to a more specific diagnosis might be to look for case studies of unusual presentations of disorders in a list such as this. 

Another source of diseases like this is the exclusions list for a [research study](http://www.nova.edu/nim/study-of-me-cfs-in-men.html) on CFS I'm considering participating in.

> Exclusions:  Exclude active disease processes that explain most of the major symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, and cognitive dysfunction.  It is essential to exclude certain diseases, which would be  tragic  to  miss:  Addison’s  disease,  Cushing’s  Syndrome,  hypothyroidism,  hyperthyroidism,  iron deficiency, other treatable forms of anemia, iron overload syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cancer.  It is also  essential  to  exclude  treatable  sleep  disorders  such  as  upper  airway  resistance  syndrome  and obstructive  or  central  sleep  apnea;  rheumatological  disorders  such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis,  lupus, polymyositis and polymyalgia rheumatica; immune disorders such as AIDS; neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinsonism, myasthenia gravis and B12 deficiency; infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, chronic hepatitis, Lyme disease, etc.; primary psychiatric disorders and substance abuse. Exclusion of other diagnoses, which cannot be reasonably excluded by the patient’s history and physical examination, is achieved by laboratory testing and imaging. If a potentially confounding medical condition is under control, then the diagnosis of ME/CFS can be entertained if patients meet the criteria otherwise.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus
Joint pain with swelling is a common symptom[^medline], as is fatigue. A textbook listed dsDNA, Sm(u2-U4-6 RNP), U1, and a bunch of others, while medline had a much shorter and different list[^medline][^chap_77]. I'm not sure what to make of that. Just as a sidenote, even [dogs can get SLE](http://www.canismajor.com/dog/autoimmn.html).

### Mixed Connective Tissue Disease
From [this](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mixed-connective-tissue-disease/basics/definition/CON-20026515?p=1) description it sounds like a possible stretch for clinical presentation of a case like mine. One lab test for it looks for presence of the autoantibody U1RNP[^medline]. This is confirmed on [this](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/334482-workup) medline page (assuming undifferentiated connective tissue disease and mixed connective tissue disease are the same thing).

### Migratory Sensory Neuropathy

### Vasculitis

### Hashimoto's disease
The immune system attacks the thyroid gland, often leading to hypothyroidism; that is, the thyroid produces less thyroid hormone. The thyroid hormones are triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) and thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>). Also relevant is thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland. Muscle pain, joint pain, and fatigue are listed as symptoms, along with some other fairly nonspecific symptoms[^NIH_hashimotos].

Blood tests can measure T<sub>3</sub>,  T<sub>4</sub>, and TSH. Blood tests also exist for detecting the presence of antibodies that attack the thyroid[^labtestsonline_thyroid_aab].

There may be some controversy about the ranges for thyroid hormones used for determing whether thyroid disfunction is present. Unfortunately information on the topic is murky because hypothyroidism is a topic for popular doctors and functional medecine practitioners, whose writings must unfortunately be treated with skepticism. Content from such authors include [this](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-raphael-kellman/why-routine-blood-tests-o_b_6801130.html) article and this [blog post](http://chriskresser.com/5-thyroid-patterns-that-wont-show-up-on-standard-lab-tests/).

[This paper](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jc.2005-0455) looks reasonably legit, published in a journal with an impact factor of 6.2[^jcem_impact]. It's also cited by a number of highly cited papers[^scholar_citing_papers]. I didn't read it closely, but from the abstract I didn't get the impression that people with hypothyroid-like symptoms should spend a lot of effort researching Hashimoto's if their thyroid hormone serum levels are in the normal range. It might be worth delving deeper into this though.

I'd be hesitant to trust the content of [this article](https://experiencelife.com/article/autoimmune-disorders-when-your-body-turns-on-you/), but it does have a nice list of disorders in which autoimmunity is thought to play a role.

### Mast Cell Activation Disorders

### Vitamin D deficiency

### Narcolepsy
There are some tools for self-assessing narcolepsy symptoms [here](http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/narcolepsy/diagnosing-narcolepsy/narcolepsy-self-evaluation).

[This summary of a research study](http://www.hypersomniafoundation.org/its-a-fine-line-between-type-2-narcolepsy-and-idiopathic-hypersomnia-and-its-getting-even-finer/) presents new evidence about the relationship between narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.

### Idiopathic Hypersomnia
It mentions on [this NIH page](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000803.htm) that idiopathic hypersomnia is usually treated with amphetamines.
The first paragraph of the [wikipdedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_hypersomnia) on idiopathic hypersomnia takes dim view of progress on the disorder.

### Insomnia
I list this here because I'm not *totally* sure that the term insomnia doesn't sometimes denote conditions where the patient doesn't realize they aren't sleeping well/getting enough sleep.
