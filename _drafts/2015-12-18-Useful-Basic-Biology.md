### Immunoglobulins
Immunoglobulin is another word for antibody[^some_assaymaker_site]. All antibodies(Ab)/immunoglobulins(Ig) are produced in white blood cells, a.k.a. plasma cells. Specifically, they are produced in cells called B cells, or B lymphocytes[^brittanica_Ig]. There are a number of categories of Ig called isotypes. The isotypes are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE.

It turns out that many antibodies share some common structure. Antibodies of the same isotype share a common substructure, and differ in other parts of the structure. The difference in the non-shared part of their structure is what allows different antibodies to bind to different antigens. However, the common substructure enables classification of the antibodies[^brittanica_Ig].
