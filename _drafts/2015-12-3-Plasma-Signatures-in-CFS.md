title: Plasma Signatures in CFS 
---

The CFI/Hutchins Family Foundation folks, e.g., Mady Hornig, the Stanford crowd, published a [paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465185/pdf/1400121.pdf) in February in which they present evidence of identifiable plasma content chronic fatigue syndrome(CFS) patients.

* 2 large, multi-center studies, an NIH study and the CFI study.
* Time of day was controlled
* Variables on which controls and patients were matched:
* Previous attempts were made to find immunological biomarkers of CFS (in 2006 and 2003), but the authors of the current paper report that those studies produced inconsistent results.
* "Immune signatures" in the paper means 51 cytokines
* In the analysis they publisehd, they separate short (<=3 years) and long (>3 years) illness duration patients.
* Plasma concentrations of a bunch of cytokines were measured.
* Inclusion criteria:
** For the NIH study, Fukuda 1994 criteria and Canadian 2003 criteria including the 2010 expanded definition.

### What is plasma?
The extra-cellular matrix of blood cells, that is, the stuff that holds blood cells in suspension in whole blood (i.e., blood when it's in the body). Plasma - clotting factors i.e. fibrinogens = serum. It's prepared by spinning a tube of fresh blood with an anti-coagulant in a centrifigue until the blood cells and plasma separate. I think you get blood serum by doing the same thing but not addding the anti-coagulant.

### What are cytokines?
Small proteins emitted by cells to communicate with other cells.
