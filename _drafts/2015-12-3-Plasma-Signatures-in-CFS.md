title: Plasma Signatures in CFS 
---

The CFI/Hutchins Family Foundation folks, e.g., Mady Hornig, the Stanford crowd, published a [paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465185/pdf/1400121.pdf) in February in which they present evidence of identifiable plasma content chronic fatigue syndrome(CFS) patients.

* 2 large, multi-center studies, an NIH study and the CFI study.
* Time of day was controlled
* Variables on which controls and patients were matched:
* Previous attempts were made to find immunological biomarkers of CFS (in 2006 and 2003), but the authors of the current paper report that those studies produced inconsistent results.
* "Immune signatures" in the paper means 51 cytokines
* In the analysis they publisehd, they separate short (<=3 years) and long (>3 years) illness duration patients.
* Plasma concentrations of a bunch of cytokines were measured.
* Inclusion criteria:
  * For the NIH study, participants met *both* the Fukuda 1994 criteria and Canadian 2003 criteria, including the 2010 expanded definition. It's not clear to me yet how they used both the 2003 and 2010 definitions at the same time.
  * For the CFI study, participants met *either or both* of the Fukuda criteria and the 2003 criteria.

Somehow the authors didn't include a citation for CFI study. Here it is, although unfortunately it's not open access[^CFI_study].

### What is plasma?
The extra-cellular matrix of blood cells, that is, the stuff that holds blood cells in suspension in whole blood (i.e., blood when it's in the body). Plasma - clotting factors i.e. fibrinogens = serum. It's prepared by spinning a tube of fresh blood with an anti-coagulant in a centrifigue until the blood cells and plasma separate. I think you get blood serum by doing the same thing but not addding the anti-coagulant.

### What are cytokines?
Small proteins emitted by cells to communicate with other cells.
