title: How Well Do Your Symptoms Fit the CFS Template?
---

There's a ton of really exciting research coming out about chronic fatigue syndrome, and you may wonder to what degree that research pertains to your case. To assess, check out the case definitions that the studies use for patient inclusion. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465185/pdf/1400121.pdf) uses all three of the definitions I've seen in the literature. 

The oldest is the 1994 Fukuda definition.
The original Canadian definition: http://www.ahmf.org/me_cfs_overview.pdf
The revised Canadian definition: http://thescipub.com/PDF/ajbbsp.2010.120.135.pdf
