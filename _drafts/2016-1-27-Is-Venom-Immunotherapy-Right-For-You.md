title: Is Venom Immunotherapy Right for You 
---

### **Questions**

**1.)** How likely are you to have a systemic reaction in the event of a sting with/without VIT? How likely is a subsequent sting to be fatal with/without VIT? Relevant variables are: how strong your initial reaction was; how much venom was injected in the subsequent exposure; what types of venom you were initially and subsequently exposed to.

**Answer**: I suspect that I'm going to decide it's too much of a pain to slog through the literature, and I'll instead rely on my immunologist's feeling that my allergic reaction wasn't terribly powerful and that I was on the border between a VIT recommendation case and a VIT non-recommendation case. I'll read the 2014 review (see below) though and see if there's information in there for making a more informed decision.

**2.)** How likely are you to get a stung? To pose the question more thoroughly, what's the probability distribution over exposure quantities?

**Answer**: Same as above.

**3.)** How much of a pain is it to get VIT?

This question is divided into several subquestions, I'll handle each in turn in this list.

  * Where can you go to get it?
    * In London, I think you have to [see a GP first](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1094.aspx?categoryid=68&subcategoryid=153), get a referral from her to see a specialist. [This page](https://www.allergyuk.org/the-management-of-allergy/immunotherapy) says a specialist decides if you need VIT. [This NHS search page](http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Hospital/LocationSearch/7/ConsultantResults?Name=e.g.%20Singh%20or%20John%20Smith&Distance=25&Location.Latitude=51.536304473877&Location.Longitude=-0.134296000003815&Location.Id=0&location.Name=nw10ry&ResultsOffset=0&ResultsPerPage=10&SearchMethod=1&Specialty=40) says that there are immunologists at [this](https://www.google.com/maps/place/great+ormond+street+hospital/@51.5225023,-0.1207834,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xd8aa6320117dd9ca?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiF_rC1tsrKAhVFVyYKHcgeCy0Q_BIIkgEwEQ) reasonably close-by hospital, for whatever that's worth.
    * Is there a way I could short circuit that system using my US immunologist's decision that I should have VIT?
    * I'm actually not sure that the NHS prescribes VIT for insect sting anaphylaxis. [This page](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Anaphylaxis/Pages/Introduction.aspx) about anaphylaxis doesn't mention VIT.
    * I emailed Kate Parkyn and the [UCL patient liason group (PALS)](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/pandv/helpandsupport/pals/Pages/HowtocontactPALS.aspx) at PALS@uclh.nhs.uk. More information about PALS [here](http://www.nhs.uk/chq/pages/1082.aspx?CategoryID=68).
  * How long do I need to be at the administration facility for each session?
    * [This clinic](http://www.texasallergyonline.com/allergy.php?id=369201) keeps patients for 20 to 30 minutes after the injection is administered.
    * [This page](http://www.insectstings.co.uk/immunotherapy/) shows an image of a package of venom that says that the patient should be kept in the hospital for at least an hour after the injection.
  * How often do I need to have it done?
    * The [2014 review](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2012&q=venom+immunotherapy+practice+parameters&hl=en&as_sdt=0,34) mentions that there is "heterogeneity ... in protocols among hospitals, even in specific countries". It says that while the patient is progressing towards the maintenance dose the interval between treatments could be as long as a week or as short as a few hours (! a few hours seems like a terrible idea). It says that during the maintenance phase, guidelines suggest 4-6 week intervals, noting that some studies support extending the interval up to four months. Unfortunately the section of the review from which I got this information are very poorly written, so I'm reluctant to take it as entirely authoritative. 
    * [This acaai.org page for the general public](http://acaai.org/allergies/treatment/allergy-shots-immunotherapy) has a general blurb about immunotherapy schedules. It says that injections will be given once or more per week for 30 weeks - almost 7 months (ugh...), then once every 4 weeks for the remaing ~2.5-~4.5 years. Wow, that's a lot. This would be the relatively slow option described in the revie paper and [here](http://www.insectstings.co.uk/immunotherapy/). Perhaps one of the faster options would be worth investigating as a way to reduce the time cost of VIT.
  * For how many years do I need to have it done? 
    * From the [2014 review:](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11882-014-0449-1)

> Currently, the common accepted policy for stopping immunotherapy
is 3â€“5 years; however, longer-term treatment shall be
considered in those patients with a higher risk of severe systemic
reactions (SSR) (e.g., older age, history of previous SSR,
elevated basal serum tryptase, mast cell activation syndrome, or
use of beta-blockers).

**Answer**: It looks like VIT comes at a **very** significant time cost.

**4.)** Does fire ant VIT protect against systemic reactions to other insect stings?

This seems like a very important question, but I haven't seen it addressed.

**5.)** Do fire ants even exist in the UK?

If the answer to this question is no and the answer to question #4 is no, there's very little reason to get fire ant VIT.

It's hard to say, googling "are there stinging ants in the uk" turns up some fairly unrelated results and [this page](http://www.insectstings.co.uk/fire-ants/) that says fire ants are "restricted primarily to the US" (no citation). [This page](http://www.antnest.co.uk/species.html) however says that Myrmica rubra and Tetramorium caespitum exist in the UK and deliver painful stings. 

**Answer**: It looks like there are some stinging ants, but I have limited information.


### Information Resources

[This page](http://www.texasallergyonline.com/allergy.php?id=369201) is produced by some kind of clinic, and has a ton really useful nitty-gritty practical information about getting VIT. It doesn't supply references though.

[This page](http://www.insectstings.co.uk/immunotherapy/) didn't look super legit at first glance, but it has information in agreement with the academic review, and additionally it pointed me to the UK's national institute for health and care excellence (NICE)'s technical appraisal of VIT it pointed me to the UK's national institute  for health and care excellence (NICE)'s [technical appraisal of venom immunotherapy](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta246). The page summarises that the technical appraisal finds VIT to be effective and cost effective.

[Here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11882-014-0449-1) is a review of VIT research published in July of 2014. It's not available for open access, but my university library has it (hit me up). 

My old notes mention the following resources:

* Boyle RJ, Elremeli M, Hockenhull J, Cherry MG, Bulsara MK, Daniels M, et al. Venom immunotherapy for preventing allergic reactions to insect stings.

* this seemed like a worthwhile search https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2012&q=venom+immunotherapy+practice+parameters&hl=en&as_sdt=0,34
