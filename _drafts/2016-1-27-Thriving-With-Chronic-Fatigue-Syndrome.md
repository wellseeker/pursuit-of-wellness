title: Thriving with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 
---

I hope this post grows into a sprawling field of inspiration to excel with CFS. 

Inspiringly, JFK had Addison's disease, a disease that could easily be mistaken for CFS. [This Atlantic article](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/08/the-medical-ordeals-of-jfk/309469/) talks about it, and [this book by the same author](http://www.amazon.com/An-Unfinished-Life-John-Kennedy/dp/0316907928) presumably has more detail. I'd love to check that book out further.

Also Darwin.
