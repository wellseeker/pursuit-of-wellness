title: Sleep Medicine 
---

I asked my PCP for a referral to a "sleep specialist", and his office staff set up an appointment at a pulmonology and allergy clinic. I'm guessing this type of doctor would only look for sleep apnea, so it doesn't seem like a good fit for my case. In the rest of this post I'll try to learn about what types of medical diagnostics and care paradigms are available for potential sleep problems.

To get a broad sense of what's studied in sleep medicine, the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_medicine) is helpful. 
* REM sleep
* sleep apnea

The first paragraph of the [wikipdedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_hypersomnia) on idiopathic hypersomnia takes dim view of progress on the disorder.

I web searched for a polysomnography center in Durham. By the way, [this article](http://sleepjunkies.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-sleep-tracking/) describes what is usually done in a polysomnograph. The doc who heads [this polysomnography center](http://kironsleep.com/) in my area is board certified in sleep medicine. It would be worthwhile to look at the board exam topics for that specialty. There's a fair amount of useful information on the pages of that Durham sleep clinic's site, it would be worth going through that later.


### Measuring Sleep 
I tried googling "sleeping 10 hours still tired", and a ton of pages written for the public popped up. There were a bunch of similar common searches, so this is definitely something a lot of people experience. Frustratingly, a lot of the pages are mostly ads. 

I saw [an article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/16/tired-after-long-sleep_n_6800880.html) that talked about how waking up in the wrong part of the sleep cycle can lead to feelings of grogginess. This suggests that measuring what part of the sleep cycle you're in and having an alarm clock wake you up at the end of the cycle could be helpful. 

Lifehacker.com has a lot of interesting articles on the topic. I'm seeing various recommendations, such as avoiding caffeine and electronics after dark, but I'm not sure whether those would be helpful for my specific case. As [this article](http://lifehacker.com/5828581/how-i-achieved-better-sleep-with-the-help-of-technology) says

> There are plenty of opinions about how you can sleep better, and most of them are probably right for someone, but it's hard to know which ones are right for you with all the variables in the mix.

That article also mentions that spending a night in a sleep clinic is costly, in comparison to at-home measurement tools. I'm guessing/assuming that the sleep clinic study this author is talking about is the polysomnograph test I was expecting to get from an MD. It talks positively about a couple of phone apps and other sleep measurement products, which I'll try.

People have reported benefits from simply computing when to go to bed so that they wake up at the end of a cycle. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/3k3agq/sleepytime_site_that_helps_you_figure_out_when_to/) app helps with that.

[This article](http://sleepjunkies.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-sleep-tracking/) seems to have a lot of useful information about sleep tracking devices used in clinics and those available for home use. The article is a year old, and says that at the time of writing there wasen't currently any EEG sleep measurement devices on the consumer market since Zeo went out of business.

It looks like there was [a company[(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeo,_Inc.) making EEG devices for tracking sleep, but it went out of business. There are two kickstarters, [kokoon](https://kokoon.io/) and [neuroon](https://neuroon.com/), that look relevant, but neither are done, and I think both should be treated with healthy skepticism.

Another device marketed for sleep monitoring is called [hello](https://hello.is/?gclid=Cj0KEQiAn8i0BRDur-HV1PCTy4UBEiQAPuFr9DNLPDJwUk5TIZo1hrjSnENsVU54oh_t6fVnvnDznSIaAoFh8P8HAQ). It doesn't do the things I'm most interested in - EEG, electrooculography, electrocardiography, or electromyography - instead it measures humidity, temperature, etc in the room, as well as bed movement.

[This article](http://lifehacker.com/why-am-i-so-tired-all-the-time-even-when-i-get-enough-s-513134992) has some general tips on things to try if you're feeling tired in spite of enough rest. One idea was eating more carbs and less fat, another was checking for vitamin D deficiency.
