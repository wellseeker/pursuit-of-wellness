Hypermobility type: http://www.ednf.org/hypermobility-type

Is it worth getting genetic testing for EDS?
Are there any other biomarkers for EDS?

**Q:** Is an EDS diagnosis appropriate when no family members had overt symptoms?  
**A:** [This paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1279/) says

> Most individuals diagnosed with the syndrome have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by de novo mutation is unknown. 

**Q:** Could my Dad have EDS?

[Some slides](http://www.ednf.org/sites/default/files/Chopra_Chronic_pain_and_EDS_Final_1slideS.pdf) on pain management for EDS. A lot of useful looking info, but very sparse in detail.

[This page](http://learnaboutyourpain.com/types-of-pain/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/) has a lot of information on EDS generally, including long descriptions of the 6 types, but lacks references or descriptions of original research.

Another source for information EDS is available [here](http://www.ednf.org/images/stories/leaflets/soyouthinkyoumighthaveeds.pdf); this one is written by an RN in a very patient-friendly style.

A quick bottom line: [this paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1279/) has set of diagnostic criteria that my case doesn't satisfy.
