title: What's this weird blog all about?! 
---

Living with a chronic undiagnosed illness is hard. Feeling like you're the only one who experiences this sort of thing is way harder, and luckily, you don't have to. There are a lots of use out there, and a lot of great bloggers sharing their experiences. This blog will have a slightly different focus, although the sharing of frustrating experiences with the medical industry will certainly be a fun and useful sideshow. Instead, here I'll be focusing on my efforts to delve into the basic scientific and clinical literatures on various conditions that I might have. Along the way I'll highlight disparities the ideas one would get in those brief encounters with doctors, and the ideas that come through when looking directly at research studies. Hopefully this blog will provide some useful pointers for other people experiencing mysterious, vague, and debilitating symptoms. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat, I'd love to hear from you. 

So to get started, what are we working with in our diagnostic quest, from the getgo? Or in other words, what is this guy even complaining about? 

* Knee pain, left side, 2.5 years and ongoing, impervious to physical therapy, multiple negative MRIs and X-rays. Feels like "joint pain".
* Pain in groin muscle, right side, 2.5 years and ongoing, impervious to physical therapy, negative MRI. Feels like "muscle pain". 
* Pain under collarbone, left side, 2.5 years and ongoing, impervious to physical therapy, negative MRI, negative X-rays. Feels like "muscle pain".
* Pain in hamstring, right side, 7 months and ongoing. Feels like "muscle pain". 
* RSI-like pain in both forearms, 5 months. Felt like "muscle pain". Prevented me from typing, and made everything from tying my shoes to eating to driving very difficult.
* Cycles of severe fatigue, usually lasting for 3-7 weeks, and occurring about as often for the last 1.5 years. These periods are characterized by constantly tiredness, in spite of consistent 9+ hours of sleep per night. During these periods, it's not unusual for me to sleep 10+ hours per night and still feel very tired.
* Chronic diarrhea, lasting for 3 months. Since, I've been very sensitive to gluten, and often have diarrhea, although it's no longer daily.
 

Other potentially diagnostically relevant facts.

* Family history of the inflammatory illnesses Celiac's disease and dermatamyositis. 
* Family history of seborrheic dermatitis (could be misdiagnosed psoriasis).
* Recently, anaphylactic reaction to hymenoptera venom (i.e. ant and bee stings).
* History of urethritis.
