title: How'd you get this blog up? 
---

I used to have a wordpress blog, but I didn't like the lack of workflow automation. I searched around for a blog I could operate from the command line, and I found Rajasekar Elango's super helpful [post](http://erajasekar.com/posts/blogging-platform-hackers-octopress-docpad-poole/) on his own search for such a tool. On his recommendation, I went with Jekyll/Poole which has, in addition to some snazzy themes and a great interface for programmers, easy access to free hosting on github. For setup instructions, I used Rajasekar's really helpful follow up [post](http://erajasekar.com/posts/set-up-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) describing how he set his blog up. I'd definitely recommend Rajasekar's blog, Jekyll and Poole.
