title: What's up with medicine? 
---

The first thing I'd like to do when searching for a diagnosis for my specific issues is to gain a high level understanding of the fields of clinical and scientific medicine. In other words, I want to at least know the names of other of the branches of medicine, what each is concerned with, and what it's foundational scientific findings and technologies are. As Elon Musk said when asked how he learns so much in short periods of time:

<div class="message">
One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree â€” make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.
</div>

It's a nice metaphor, but I'm going to think of medicine instead as a forest, where each tree is a domain of clinical practice or a field of scientific research. I want to at least know where all the trees are, and understanding what their fruit is useful for. 

So to get started, I searched online for med school curricula. Despite what it seems like sometimes from talking to them, doctors probably get an overview of what's been accomplished in modern medicine so far during their 4 year degree. With a quick web search and a bit of browsing, I found UT Southwestern's nicely documented [coursework plan](http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/education/medical-school/academics/curriculum/first-year.html).

It seems like in the first two years, they cover a list of basic sciences, in the third year they cover a swath of clinical disciplines, and in the fourth year they specialize in a clinical discipline. Based on what I found in their curriculum, as well as a fair amount of browsing links on Wikipedia's [outline of medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_medicine), [outline of health sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_health_sciences), and [list of interdisciplinary fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine#Interdisciplinary_fields), I came up with the following lists of names of medical areas.

* Anatomy
* Biochemistry
* Cell Biology
* Human Behavior
* Genetics
* Immunology 
* Physiology
* Microbiology, Molecular Biology
* Pathology
* Pharmacology
* Neuroscience
* Embryology

There are some topics that deal with specific types of ailments.

* Infectious Disease
* Oncology

Then there is a bunch of domains that deal with a specific organ or set of organs.

* Cardiology
* Dermatology
* Endocrinology
* Gastroenterology
* Hepatology
* Pulmonology 
* Hematology
* Neurology
* Nephrology
* Opthalmology
* Otolarygology
* Urology
* Podiatry
* Obstetrics and Gynecology

Then there are some topics that deal with specific types of patients. 

* Pediatrics
* Geriatrics

Others topics are hard to classify.

* Anesthesiology

Other topics that aren't as canonical as the others I've listed seem relevant to me.

* Psychneuroimmunology
* Functional Medicine

That's a lot of topics, so I won't have time to learn about each one. Instead I'll apply cruide pruning heuristic, basically only looking topics that "seem relevant", as far as I can tell. For each one that isn't pruned, I'll make a separate post describing what it's all about, and what, if any, relevance it might have.
