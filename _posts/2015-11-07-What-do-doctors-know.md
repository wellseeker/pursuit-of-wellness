title: What do doctors know? 
---

In the last post I worked on establishing a roadmap of medicine by browsing Wikipedia's outline of medicine and looking at online med school syllabi. Another avenue I tried was reaching out to one of my most excellent homies, a true life med student, to ask what he learned during the first years of his program. Based on his amazingly helpful answer and a bit of other content I found web searching, in this post I'll try to list the basic sciences taught to doctors. My hope is that this will be helpful not only for giving an overview of what is known in medicine, but also for communicating with clinicians - a skill I could really benefit from as a patient. 

## Med School

My medical pal confirmed that during the first two of the four years of traditional med school, instruction is focused on basic science, and that instruction in clinical practices is reserved for the 3rd and 4rth years. The first year covers normal physiology while the second year covers pathology. The metric of a student's success during these two years is her score on the [USMLE Step 1 Exam](http://www.usmle.org/step-1/), so the content of that exam is pretty much all you need to get a sense of what med students are jamming into their brains during that two years. It seems like a pretty standard resource for studying for the test is the [First Aid book on the subject](http://www.amazon.com/First-Aid-USMLE-Step-2015/dp/0071840060). 

This is great for me, because it means I can pretty much ignore everything else and just check out that First Aid book. In the last section of this post, I'll read over the main topics covered in that book, and add in anything my med student amigo mentioned that he studied that wasn't in the book.

## Residency

Every doctor I've seen also did a residence in some discipline. If the doc wasn't acting as a specialist, he or she typically had done a residency in internal medicine. In order to get a sense of what the doc probably learned during her residency, it's probably worth looking through the contents of board exam for her specialty. At the moment it doesn't feel super relevant for me to do this for any specialty, but if I do, I'll post what I find. 

As a quick sidenote, I talked with a doc who was board certified in allergy/immunology and internal medicine, and when I asked whether training in either of his specialties covered chronic fatigue syndrome, he told me he'd never heard the disease.

## Topics Covered in Med School 

This section is in progress, so that topics farther down are covered less thoroughly.

### Molecular

* Chromatin structure and function: how DNA, RNA, and proteins are are bound together and function inside of a cell.
* Nucleotides: the building blocks of nucleic acids like DNA and RNA.
* Synthesis of the nucleotides purine and pyramidine: important in part because various drugs work by inhibiting this synthesis.
* Purine salvage deficiencies: Some diseases are caused by this.
* DNA replication
* DNA mutations
* Lac operon: an operon is a cluster of DNA that is transcribed as a package. Glucose and lactose levels determine the degree to which this operon is transcribed. This illustrates the effect the environment can have on gene function. 
* DNA repair
* DNA/RNA/protein synthesis direction: These things have a directionality, and apparently it's important what direction they're transribed in.
* Start and stop codons: specific sequences of nuclei that code for starting and stopping transcription
* Functional organization of the eukaryotic gene: Locations of important components of a gene. 
* Regulation of gene expression: Promoters, enhancers, and silencers
* RNA polymerases: enzymes that synthesize RNA during replication
* Introns vs exons
* tRNA: type of RNA that helps decode an mRNA molecule
* Post-translational modifications: trimming  and adding 
* Protein synthesis: initiation, elongation, termination
* Protein folding
* Chaperone protein: intracellular protein that facilitates protein folding

#### Cellular

* Cell cycle: series of events that occur leading up to the division and duplication of a cell
* Rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulums: different types of things happen at these sites.
* Cell trafficking: how different things move around inside of a cell
* Proteasomes and peroxisomes: catabolize proteins and fats inside of a cell
* Cytoskeleton: network of protein fibers inside of a cell that support organelle movement, cell division, and cell structure. 
* Immunohistochemical stains: various stains for cells such as connective tissue, muscles, and neurons. 
* Microtubules: a component of the cytoskeleton found throughout the cytoplasm. There are some drugs that act on microtubules.
* Plasma membrane composition
* Sodium potassium pump
* Collagen: protein that makes up much of the body. There are several types of it, and defects in the different types cause different ailments. Some information about its synthesis and structure are important.
* Elastin: another important protein that makes up organs such as skin and lungs. 

#### Lab Techniques
* Polymer chain reaction: amplifies desired fragments of DNA. The amplified fragments can be used as a diagnostic tool
* Gel electrophoresis: technique for separating macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and proteins)
* Blotting: transferring biological samples from a gel to a membrane then identifying the contents of samples on the membrane
* Western blotting: using antibodies that bind to specific proteins in order to identify proteins in a blot
* Southern blotting: using a DNA probe - which binds to a specific DNA sequence and lights up - to identify DNA sequences in a blot
* Northern blot: like the southern blot but for RNA
* Southwestern blot: detects proteins that bind to DNA
* Microarrays: uses DNA/RNA probes to detect the presence of DNA/RNA sequences.
* Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIZA): uses antigens or antibodies to detect the presence of antigens or antibodies in a patient's blood sample 
* Karotype: chromosomes are stained and sorted based on various features. used to diagnose chromosomal imbalances.
* Fluorescent in situ hybridization: fluorescent DNA/RNA hybrizes to sequences of DNA/RNA on chromosomes, rather than chopped up sequences on a plate as in microarrays.
* Cre-lox system: lab tool for carrying out gene mutations. uses an enzyme called cre recombinase on sequences called lox sequences.
* RNA interference: synthesized dsRNA reduces the effect of complementary mRNA, reducing gene expression.
 
#### Genetics 

* Diseases that happen when there are problems with genes
* Dominant, recessive, and other such traits. diseases carried as different types of traits.

#### Nutrition

* Fat and water soluble vitamins, how they work and what happens when they're deficient. 


#### Metabolism

* Processes by which different things are metabolized
* Disorders of metabolism of different things

### Microbiology

#### Bacteriology 

* Components of a bacteria - what each component is made out of and what its function is.
* Components of the cell wall of bacteria
* Taxonomy of bacteria based on their shape and gram positivity vs negativity.
* Stains for various gram-negative bacteria.
* Culture requirements for many different bacteria
* Aerobes and anaerobes: bacteria that can and can't survive in air. 
* Intracellular bacteria
* Examples of encapsulated bacteria, i.e., bacteria that have a polysaccharide outer covering
* Vaccines for encapsulated bacteria - have to be polysaccharide capsule antigens 
* Urease positive bacteria: many GI and urinary tract pathogens produce urease, which can be detected. I think the test requires a biopsy.
* Intracellular bacteria: some bacteria live inside the host cells, including rickettsia and chlamydia 
* Catalase positive bacteria: catalase is a common enzyme in organisms exposed to oxygen, protecting them from toxic byproducts of oxygen metabolisma. Some clinically relevant bacteria seem to produce catalase while others don't, and catalase can probably be detected using some laboratory method, it's possible to distinguish between various pathogens by testing for catalase.
* Pigment producing bacteria: memorize some bacteria that produce pigment
* Bacterial virulence factors: factors, typically proteins that are expressed by a bacteria that promotes its evasion of the host's response. For example, IgA protease cleaves IgA, and is secreted by e.g. pneumonia and influenza.
* Type III secretion system: aka injectisome, a needle-like protein appendage from a bacteria used to inject toxins into a host cell.
* Exotoxins and endotoxins: The former are emitted by bacteria, while the latter remain on the outer membrane of the bacteria. Exo are typically polypeptides while endo are typically lipopolysaccharides. Exo are fatal in much smaller doses than endo. Different levels of heat are necessary to destroy them.
* Memorize a bunch of bacteria that release exotoxins, the mechanism of the exotoxin, and the clinical manifestation.

### Bacterial Genetics

* Transformation: the process by which bacteria take up free dna molecules.
* Conjugation: process wherein bacteria exchange dna.
* Transposition: when section of dna excises from its location in a strand and reintegrates in another section. dna can transpose from a plasmid to a chromosome.
* Transduction: process wherein dna is transferred from what bacterium to another by a virus

### Clinical Bacteriology

* Gram positive and negative diagnosis algorithms
* Appearance under microscope on blood agar of various bacteria
* Clinical presentation of various bacterial infections
* Mycosis, i.e., fungal infections
* Protozoa in the gastro tract, CNS, blood
* Nematodes and cestodes (roundworms and tapeworms), trematodes

### Virology

* Virus: small infectious agent that replicates only inside the cells of other organisms
* Capsid: protein shell of a virus
* Virus structures vary in complexity, from just a capsid with nucleic acid inside, to surface protein plus lipid bilayer plus capsid with nucleic acid inside.
* There are some genetic processes specific to viruses.
* Some viral vaccines have live attenuated viruses, some have dead viruses, some have a subcomponent of the virus.
* Prions: infectious agents made up entirely of protein

### Other microbiology

* Normal flora in various parts of the body
* Bacteria that cause food poisoning, diarrhea, pneumonia, meningitis
* Urinary tract infections
* Antimicrobials, e.g., drugs that prevent microbial disease.
