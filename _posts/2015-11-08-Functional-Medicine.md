title: Functional Medicine - Probably Not a Real Thing 
---

I read in [this article on huff post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deborah-j-cornwall/still-undiagnosed-three-p_b_5837528.html) that the Cleveland Clinic recently established a center for something called functional medicine. Huff post definitely has a lot of click bait and junk content, but the other items in the list on this particular page seemed reasonably legit - the NIH's undiagnosed diseases network and CrowdMed. Also the Cleveland Clinic is a hospital people like, so plenty of signs pointed toward this being a legitimate up-and-coming movement in medicine.

A red flag flew up though when I couldn't find even a single publication in my university's library system describing original research on this topic. I web searched around and found some content on the topic written by FM supporters, e.g., from the fancy sounding [Institute for Functional Medicine](https://www.functionalmedicine.org/). Unfortunately all of this content uses only very vague language, and fail to describe exactly what kinds of interventions they perform. I did find some descriptions of what FM practioners actually do on the [FM Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_medicine#Description), and it was all very dubious.

So to summarize, there's a lack of peer reviewed resources, information created by supporters is extremely vague, and the only other information I could find suggests that FM practices are highly unsound. 

A number of people on [this reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1mrawq/what_is_functional_medicine_and_is_it_legitimate/) echo this disappointment. [sciencebasedmedicine.org](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/) and [Quackwatch](http://www.quackwatch.com/) have published petty tirades against FM. I can't get behind the heated closed-mindedness and abrasive language that characterize their posts, but they make essentially make the same points made elsewhere - there isn't any peer reviewed research behind the practices of FM, and practitioners of FM use vague and misleading language in their correspondence with the public. 

There's also a hilarious conversation on [the straight dope](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=596520) where a number of people express this problem, then a purported supporter of FM huffily brags his way through a very silly sounding anecdote in which FM saves the day, then gets kicked off the site for getting caught creating a second account to sing his own personal praises on the thread.

That entertaining debacle aside, I wanted to understand why a hospital like the Cleveland Clinic would want to be associated with and apply resources to this. I looked up the person who is leading the FM center at Cleveland Clinic, and got a little bit of insight into this question. The guy is [Mark Hyman](http://drhyman.com/), and he has a very nice looking website with lots of very click-baity list posts and videos of him hanging out with Dr. Oz. Although I couldn't find that he'd ever published anything reviewed by peers, he's produced a lot of diet books and is the health consultant to the Clintons. So maybe regular people, unlike scientists and typical allopaths, just really like this guy. It's pretty mystifying to me, if anyone has any more insight on this I'd love to hear from you. For now though I'll have to call it and direct my attention to more well supported topics.
