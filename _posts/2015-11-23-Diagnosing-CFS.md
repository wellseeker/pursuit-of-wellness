title: Diagnosing CFS 
---

There's a ton of really exciting research coming out about chronic fatigue syndrome, and you may wonder to what degree that research pertains to your case. To assess, check out the case definitions that the studies use for patient inclusion.  

* The oldest criteria is the 1994 [Fukuda definition](http://www.cfids-me.org/cdcdefine.html)[^fukuda_paper]. The full text of this paper is available online.
* The [original Canadian definition](http://www.ahmf.org/me_cfs_overview.pdf)[^original_canadian]. The full text isn't available online, or even through my university library, but there's a thorough summary document available online.
* The [revised Canadian definition](http://thescipub.com/PDF/ajbbsp.2010.120.135.pdf)[^revised_canadian]. The full text of this paper is available online.

Many important studies that use these criteria, for example these. [^database_study] [^plasma_signature_study]

### Ambiguity in the Criteria
Looking at the various criteria, I've found myself wondering whether or not I fit specific items of the criteria. As an example, the 2003 definition lists myalgia as one of it's components, and it mentions that the myalgia is often migratory. I certainly have myalgia, but I think it's probably not what they mean by migratory. The myalgia in my case isn't the kind of completely idiopathic myalgia I think they probably mean, since it's related to activity and seems to have roots in sports injuries. 

That's an example of the kind of interpretation that needs to be done when using these criteria. It's unfortunate, but I have to acknowledge that describing these cases is complicated, perhaps too complicate to formulate in a criteria document. 

### Criteria ambiguity in CFS research 

The authors of the CFI paper[^database_study] also acknowledge this, and say flat out in the paper that they use the clinicians judgement rather than relying on formulated criteria. 

> This study used ME/CFS expert sites to ensure true “caseness” in the recruitment effort; that is, clinicians were confident that the study enrolled subjects who suffered from ME/CFS above and beyond case definition entry criteria. 

They clarify their inclusion methods further here:

> To be eligible for inclusion in the study, cases must have had a previously confirmed diagnosis of ME/CFS, as established by an expert clinician, that met one or both of two internationally recognized case definitions...

There are problems with this human judgement approach to solving the problem of complexity in case definition, and they are that the results are no longer reproducible, and they're much less interpretable. In other words, we can't reproduce the study without having those same clinicians to find new subjects for us, and I can't read the paper and understand exactly what case definition they used. Pretty disappointing.

So if you want to obtain a diagnosis for yourself, you're left with the messy business of seeing various clinicians to get opinions, and interpreting each of their opinions based on your knowledge of the clinician. If you want to understand their results, you'd have to at least read clinical notes on a representative subset of the population. The diversity of those clinical notes would determine how many you would have to read for it to be representative.

On a more positive note, the authors of the paper do say that 

> Each research subject ... underwent a standardized evaluation that included multiple questionnaires, evaluation of prior medical records, a detailed physical examination, collection of a battery of laboratory tests and acquisition of multiple bio logical specimens...

However, the authors didn't exclude any subjects based on this data, instead the original clinician's judgement with respect to one of the criteria was the only important inclusion factor. Luckily though the CFI study paper includes some useful summary statistics about the participant's responses to these questionnaires. As a result, it's possible to obtain and fill out the questionnaires yourself and compare your resonses to those of the clinician chosen population.

### Insights from the summary statistics
Interestingly, only 91.6% of the ME/CFS participants reported the symptom "Fatigue or feeling sick for at least 24 hours after you exercise or exert yourself". I found this surprising since that type of symptom, often called post-exertional malaise (PEM), is a strict component of the Canadian definition. It could be that a higher percent of the participants would have reported the symptom if it specified a shorter duration of post-exertional fatigue. This last guess is supported by the fact that 97% and 97.5% of the participants reported the symptoms "Physically drained or sick after mild activity", and "Next day soreness or fatigue after non-strenuous, everyday activities", respectively. 

Those >97% figures are based on the definition of a positive response as reported severity scores greater than 0 out of 4. If a positive response is instead defined as scores greater than 1 out of 4, the figures drop to 87% and 77% respectively. This leaves some doubt for me about whether all of the patients experience PEM. However, it's certainly clear that a majority of these clinician-diagnosed participants have PEM-like symptoms.

### PEM and the difference between the Fukuda and Canadian Criteria
Intriguingly, the percentage of patients who did not report the PEM symptom from the beginning of the last section (8.4%), is similar to the number of patients who met the Fukuda criteria but not the Canadian criteria (9.4%). This makes sense, because, as the authors note, the main difference between the two criteria is that the Canadian absolutely requires PEM, while Fukuda does not. Admittedly, another important difference is that the Canadian places a heavier emphasis on autonomic, neuroendocrine, and other less nonspecific symptoms. However, the numbers remain suggestive that the PEM differences in the criteria are reflected in patients scores.

Correspondingly, the authors make a very important point about PEM and the two criteria. They point out that their results differ markedly from previous studies wherein Fukuda was the only criteria used. Not surprisingly, in those studies PEM was reported by a much lower number of patients. The go on to point out the PEM is very rare in comparison to more nonspecific symptoms like general fatigue.

### What's the bottom line on the importance of PEM for diagnosing CFS?
If you're like me, you have generalized fatigue but PEM, not so much. This is may be a common predicament given that PEM is a apparently a less common phenomenon in the overall population. If this is your situation, you'll need to take care in generalizing results of *all* of the studies that use the CFI dataset. The population studied could differ in an important way from your case.

That's by no means to say that the results from those studies aren't relevant to your situation. 

* CFS is category that has shifted during it's decades long lifetime, evidencing a set of likely interrelated but distinguishable disorders. Insights about one subcategory of CFS may be relevant to other subcategories.
* Biological markers and other phenomenon seen in patient's with PEM may also exist in those without it. Studies that use the CFI dataset can't address whether or not their results depend on the presence of PEM.
* Later studies with the CFI dataset may distinguish between patient's with and without PEM, yielding clearly interpretable results.

### Is PEM the only thing to watch out for?
Probably not. The Canadian criteria is more strict on a number of other relatively specific symptoms, so it's worth checking your symptoms against the summary statistics in the CFI paper.

### Summary
There are three main formal criteria used, but researchers actually rely on clinician judgments for inclusion in studies. It's important to find at least summary data on the clinical presentations of the participants in a study when interpreting results from it. As an example, in those post I examined a specific symptom category, PEM, in the context of a specific research dataset, the CFI dataset. This is a particularly useful example because the CFI dataset is and will continue to be used in lots of other studies.
