title: Dysautonomia 
---

As anyone might guess, this term refers broadly to malfunctioning of the autonomic nervous system. Indeed, wikipedia confirms this. It goes on to say that the symptoms experienced will depend on the organ system effected.

Dysautonomia refers to a scenario where nerves from the brain and spinal cord that control automatic body functions aren't working right. That seems pretty vague, how would you diagnose or treat that? What can cause it? In other words, is there actually any knowledge substance behind this idea?

Wikipedia lists a bunch of causes of dysautonomia, and one of the them is chronic fatigue syndrome. It says specifically that CFS is associated with malfunctioning of the sympathetic nervous system. This could simply mean "CFS patients aren't stimulated enough, so the sympathetic nervous system isn't working right, so, dysautonomia". Or there might be more substance to it.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also listed as associated with sympathetic nervous system dysautonomia. It's not clear to me why that should be, I should look into it more.

What exactly does Wikipedia mean when it says dysautonomia is associated with CFS? Maybe it's along these lines: In the Canadian CFS criteria, one of the headings is "autonomic manifestations", and under that heading there is orthostatic intolerance, light-headedness, pallor, nausea and IBS, urinary frequency and bladder disfunction, palpitations/arrhythmias, trouble breathing during exertion.

I noticed that wikipedia treats IBS as disease associated with dysautonomia, while the Canadian CFS definition treats it as a dysautonomia symptom. This is a mess.

To summarize a few minutes web searching on the topic, dysautonomia seems to refer to a bunch of symptoms, plus some results on tests, that are abnormal, along with an extremely vague idea about the etiology of those abnormalities. This is somewhat similar to the state of IBS itself, and the state of CFS - although in the case of CFS there seems to be more substantive chemical findings.
