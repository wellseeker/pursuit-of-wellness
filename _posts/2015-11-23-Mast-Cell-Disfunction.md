title: Mast Cell Disfunction

### What are  mast cell disorders?
From [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3069946/), mast cell activation disorders (MCADs) are a collection of disorders in which there is an accumulation of pathological mast cells in some subset a patient's organs and/or tissues AND there is an aberrant release of mast cell mediators. 

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastocytosis#cite_note-2) someone notes that the classification of these disorders is being reviewed for revision, and specific issues with the current classification are stated [here](http://www.mastocytosis.ca/MSC%20Patient%20Experience.pdf).

With that in mind, here's the current classification put forth in [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastocytosis#cite_note-2) paper. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) includes disorders wherein certain immunohistochemical and mutational findings are present. This category is divided into the following subtypes:

* Indolent systemic mastocytosis
* Isolated bone marrow mastocytosis
* Smoldering systemic mastocytosis
* Systemic mastocytosis with an associated clonal hematologic non-mast cell lineage disease
* Aggressive systemic mastocytosis

In addition to systemic mastocytosis, there is mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), which has the same clinical presentation as SM but the situation doesn't meet the criteria for SM.

[Here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3069946/table/T4/) is a list of  diseases to be included in a differential diagnosis with mast cell activation disease.

I should mention that there's a specific genetic mutation associated with mastocytosis.

Synthesizing what I've read, it seems like MCADs are characterized by a high degree of variability in symptom presentation, and this is explained by the fact that mast cells and their mediators are thought to pathologically affect any subset of organs and tissues in the body. This seems to make it necessary to rely on lab tests to make the diagnosis, since the clinical definition of the illness is so nonspecific.

### Mastocytosis
Here is some more information on mastocytosis I found from other sources. Mastocytosis is caused by the presence of too many mast cells and mast cell precursors (according to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastocytosis#cite_note-2)). That page also says that mastocytosis is extremely rare; there are generally considered to be <200,000 people in the US. It seems like the disease is so rare that even the clinical presentation is a matter of ongoing research. [This article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386235/) reports the symptoms of a group of mastocytosis patients. The list is quite long and includes asthenia (abnormal physical weakness or fatigue), muscle and joint pain, food allergy, frequent urination, diarrhea, anaphylaxis. Interestingly, many of the symptoms, including those I listed, are quite nonspecific, however many of the others are more specific.

[This article](http://www.mastocytosis.ca/MSC%20Patient%20Experience.pdf) describes the mastocytosis patient's experience. It's a bit vague, but it does provide an interesting perspective.

This disorder is in one way opposite to CFS - in CFS the clinical presentation has been described voluminously but there has historically been an absence of etiology. It mastocytosis the etiology is known and the clinical presentation is worthy of publication. 

### Are mast cell disorders related to CFS?

[This](/Users/sam/Downloads/out\ \(1\).pdf) paper mentions that the symptom profile of CFS, fibromyalgia, and MCADs are similar.

[This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3498825/) study provides some exceedingly indirect evidence that CFS and mast cells could be related. In this work the authors put human mast cells in a preparation with various antidepressants, and found only the tricyclic antidepressants caused a reduction in the production of some mast cell mediators. They then refer to a study of fibromyalgia patients wherein only tricyclics out of a range of antidepressants reduced pain. 

Some speculation about a possible relationship between FM or CFS and MCAD is made [here](http://www.cortjohnson.org/blog/2015/03/17/fibromyalgia-histamine-intolerance-connection/).

### How can you find out if you have SM or an MCAS?
[This](http://www.cortjohnson.org/forums/threads/differentiating-mast-cell-activation-syndrome-mcas-from-pots.2388/) blog post describes some common diagnostics. One is serum tryptase levels. If that's positive a bone marrow biopsy may be indicated. The post also mentions urinalysis for some mast cell products, but I'm not sure how well supported that test is in the literature.
