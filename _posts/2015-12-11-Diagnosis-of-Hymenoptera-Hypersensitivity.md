title: Diagnosis of Hymenoptera Venom Hypersensitivity 
---

What are the standard procedures for follow-up diagnosis of a systemic hymenoptera sting reaction?

### In vitro testing
In this type of testing blood is drawn, serum is extracted, and some kind of lab test is performed. According to [this](http://acaai.org/allergies/treatment/allergy-testing/skin-test) page the lab test could be a radioallergosorbent (RAST), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a fluorescent enzyme immunoassays (FEIA) or a chemiluminescent immunoassays.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRbuz3VQ100) explains really clearly how ELISA works.

### Intracutaneous skin testing
A small amount of the allergen is injected into the patient's skin. I read this [here](http://acaai.org/allergies/treatment/allergy-testing/skin-test).

As of the 2011 practice parameters paper the only reagent available for fire ant hypersensitivity testing was imported fire ant whole body extract.

### Skin prick testing
In this test, a tiny lesion is made in the patient's skin and then a solution containing the potential allergen, e.g., hymenoptera venom, is dropped onto the lesion. If the skin around the lesion becomes inflamed in the next thirty minutes the test is positive. Otherwise it's negative. The false negative rate is low but the false positive rate is high - 50%-60% of all skin prick tests result in false positives. I read all of the [here](http://www.foodallergy.org/diagnosis-and-testing/skin-tests).

### What are the strengths and weaknesses of these different types of test?
Again according to the practice parameters paper, up to 1/5 of patients with positive skin tests have negative in vitro IgE tests. But, other studies showed that 10%-20% of negative skin tests have positive in vitro results. This difference between the study results could be caused by differences in the sensitivity of the specific assay used.

### What about ants other than fire ants?
[This](http://urban.ucr.edu/docs/Stinging%20ants%20and%20kissing%20bugs/2005%20Klotz%20et%20al.%20Adverse%20Reactions%20to%20Ants%20Other%20Than%20Impor.pdf) 2005 paper lists other types of ants that have caused documented systemic reactions. This paper notes in the discussion that cross-reactivity has been demonstrated within the genera Solenopsis and Pogonomyrmex, but otherwise there wasn't data on cross-reactivity. 

I did a bit more literature searching, specifically by looking at the articles on Google Scholar that cited the 2005 paper, but I didn't find any other data on cross-reactivity.

### Does having an allergy to one type of hymenoptera mean you have an allergy to others?
The following paper has info on that: Hoffman DR, Dove DE, Moffitt JE, Stafford CT. Allergens in Hymenoptera venom. XXI. Cross-reactivity and multiple reactivity between fire ant venom and bee and wasp venoms. J Allergy Clin Immunol 1988;82(5):828-34.

That paper is cited in [this](http://www.phadia.com/en/Products/Allergy-testing-products/ImmunoCAP-Allergen-Information/Insects/Allergens/Fire-ant-/) very helpful summary and in [this](https://www.aaaai.org/Aaaai/media/MediaLibrary/PDF%20Documents/Practice%20and%20Parameters/Insect-hypersensitivity-2011.pdf) physician recommendation paper. [Here](http://ssai.ch/uploads/media/aj0413-Uebersicht-CME-Helbling-engl_01.pdf) is another practice recommendation paper that is slightly more recent.

That practice parameters paper says that detection of sensitivities to different types of hymenoptera requires testing with all the commercially available bee, vespid, and ant venoms. This seems to be because, although the venoms operate in similar ways, there are differences in function and individual's sensitivies.

It also mentions that limited cross-reactivity exists between fire ant venom and the venom of other hymenoptera. They even say that if the fire ant was identified as the stinging insect testing for sensitivities to other venoms is not indicated.
