title: Sleep Medicine 
---

I wondered whether the fatigue experienced in CFS-like cases may in some instances be amenable to study by methods developed in sleep medecine. In this post I'll learn what types of medical diagnostics and care paradigms are available for people who suspect sleep malfunctions, both within mainstream medicine and in the do-it-yourself scene .

### What do you get when you ask for a sleep specialist?

I asked my primary care doc for a referral to a "sleep specialist", and his office staff set up an appointment at a pulmonology and allergy clinic. I'm guessing this type of doctor would only look for sleep apnea, so it doesn't seem like a good fit for anyone who suspects a neurological sleep disorder. Luckily there are board certified sleep medicine specialists who are trained in disorders other than apnea, although breathing disorders make up a bulk of their training, as we'll see later in this post.

### The Sleep Medicine Establishment

There's an [American Board of Sleep Medicine](http://www.absm.org/sleepmedicinespecialty.aspx) and also the [American Academy of Sleep Medicine](http://www.aasmnet.org/aboutaasm.aspx). The academy has a [page](http://www.aasmnet.org/boardreview.aspx) with details about what's on the *board* sleep medicine exam. Even better, they have a more detailed [description](http://www.aasmnet.org/Resources/pdf/2015ExamBlueprint.pdf) of what's on the exam. Here's my summary:

* It says that a whopping 22% of the exam is dedicated to breathing disorders. 
* Another 20% is dedicated to normal sleep (e.g., neurophysiology, circadian rhythm, effects of sleep deprivation). 
* 10% of the exam covers sleep-wake timing. This includes what are called circadian rhythm disorders. Looking at [this page](http://www.circadiansleepdisorders.org/), it sounds like these disorders are pretty identifiable, e.g., you can't sleep until really late at night. As a result it doesn't seem worth looking into further. Shift work disorder and jet lag were also in this category.
* Another 17% goes to insomnia. Assuming insomnia refers to overt not falling asleep, this probably wouldn't apply to my situation. Based on [this](https://sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/content/what-are-different-types-insomnia), it seems like that assumption is correct, although [this](http://www.aasmnet.org/resources/factsheets/insomnia.pdf) mentions non-restorative sleep as a problem related to insomnia.  
* 12% of the exam goes to hypersomnolence, maybe there's relevant content in the sleep medicine's purview after all. 5 of those 12 percentage points are made up of content about narcolepsy types 1 and 2. Idiopathic hypersomnia is also listed (>2% of the test). One other subject that could be relevant, albeit partially because of its vague nature, is "psychiatric disorders" related to hypersomnolence (<2% of the test). Upon some cursory web searching it looks like narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia might be something worth looking into more. I'll put them in the list of commonly confused with CFS diseases.
* Another 6% of the exam is devoted to "parasomnias", which are apparently things like sleepwalking and sleep paralysis. None of the subtopics of parasomnias looked very relevant to my case. 8% of the exam is dedicated to movement disorders such as restless leg syndrome.
* Finally, 5% of the exam is dedicated to sleep in other disorders, such as headaches and anxiety. It's tough to know exactly what this content is, but I'll assume that I'd come across anything relevant when looking at the related disorders themselves, so I won't follow this further.

### Another source

In search of a broad understanding of the sleep medicine field, I also checked out the website of a specific sleep clinic. It had some useful information, for example, [on the frequently asked questions page](http://kironsleep.com/?page_id=100) they describe four disorders, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), excessive daytime somnolence (EDS), narcolepsy, and periodic limb movement syndrome. The page says that EDS can be caused by OSA, narcolepsy, or periodic limb movement syndrome. Much of the page is dedicated to OSA, and with only a bit of space spent on narcolepsy and EDS. This distribution of attention, along with the small number of conditions described, supports my concern that sleep medicine in practice targets only a few common disorders.

### Polysomnography 

After skimming several summary pages about sleep medicine, it seemed clear that the primary diagnostic tool in the field is the polysomnograph. There's also a technique called the sleep latency test, but other than that the polysomnograph seems to be about the main, if not only, go-to technique in the field.

[This article](http://sleepjunkies.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-sleep-tracking/) describes what is usually done in a polysomnograph, and [this page](http://kironsleep.com/?page_id=141) lists all of the recording methods used in a specific sleep clinic. 

[This informational page](http://www.healthline.com/health/polysomnography#Overview1) on polysomnography has a section on diagnostic uses that is mostly devoted to sleep apnea, and also lists narcolepsy and periodic limb movement like the source I talked about in the last paragraph. This page also listed REM sleep behavior disorder (acting out dreams during sleep), seizure disorders, and chronic insomnia.  

### DIY Sleep Improvement: General Help from the Web

I tried googling "sleeping 10 hours still tired", and a ton of pages written for the public popped up. There were a bunch of similar common searches, so this is definitely something a lot of people experience.  

I saw [an article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/16/tired-after-long-sleep_n_6800880.html) that talked about how waking up in the wrong part of the sleep cycle can lead to feelings of grogginess. This suggests that measuring what part of the sleep cycle you're in and having an alarm clock wake you up at the end of the cycle could be helpful. 

Lifehacker.com has a lot of interesting articles on the topic. I'm seeing various recommendations, such as avoiding caffeine and electronics after dark, but I'm not sure whether those would be helpful for my specific case. As [this article](http://lifehacker.com/5828581/how-i-achieved-better-sleep-with-the-help-of-technology) says

> There are plenty of opinions about how you can sleep better, and most of them are probably right for someone, but it's hard to know which ones are right for you with all the variables in the mix.

That article also talks positively about a couple of phone apps and other sleep measurement products.

People have reported benefits from simply computing when to go to bed so that they wake up at the end of a cycle. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/3k3agq/sleepytime_site_that_helps_you_figure_out_when_to/) app helps with that.

### DIY Sleep Measurement

[This article](http://sleepjunkies.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-sleep-tracking/) seems to have a lot of useful information about sleep tracking devices used in clinics and those available for home use. The article is a year old, and says that at the time of writing there wasen't currently any EEG sleep measurement devices on the consumer market since Zeo went out of business.

It looks like there was [a company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeo,_Inc.) making EEG devices for tracking sleep, but it went out of business. There are two kickstarters, [kokoon](https://kokoon.io/) and [neuroon](https://neuroon.com/), that look relevant, but neither are done, and I think both should be treated with healthy skepticism.

Another device marketed for sleep monitoring is called [hello](https://hello.is/?gclid=Cj0KEQiAn8i0BRDur-HV1PCTy4UBEiQAPuFr9DNLPDJwUk5TIZo1hrjSnENsVU54oh_t6fVnvnDznSIaAoFh8P8HAQ). It doesn't do the things I'm most interested in - EEG, electrooculography, electrocardiography, or electromyography - instead it measures humidity, temperature, etc in the room, as well as bed movement.

[This article](http://lifehacker.com/why-am-i-so-tired-all-the-time-even-when-i-get-enough-s-513134992) has some general tips on things to try if you're feeling tired in spite of enough rest. One idea was eating more carbs and less fat, another was checking for vitamin D deficiency.
