title: Visiting a CFS Specialist 
---

What's it like to see a bona fide specialist in CFS? I recently had an appointment with [Charles Lapp](http://drlapp.com/staff/dr-lapp/), the main doc at the [Hunter-Hopkins Professional Association](http://drlapp.com/) in Charlotte, NC, and in this post I'll give some background and describe what the experience was like. Towards the end of the post, I'll recount the highlights of a discussion we had on the topic of CFS-like cases that lack exertional malaise, which may be of interest to people experiencing symptoms that are similar to, but don't quite fit CFS. 

**TLDR:** From Dr. Lapp I received what I perceived to be a very valuable clinical opinion, as well as several useful leads towards diagnostic and treatment resources. If you're struggling with chronic fatigue and associated symptoms, I would highly recommend seeing him - as long as you're willing to tackle the difficulties of an office that doesn't work directly with insurance companies.

### Why Dr. Lapp?

I chose to see him largely because he has a solid web presence. His convincing website boasts a well populated "Ask the Doctor" forum and a "Resources" page with a lot of useful original content. He's also received a lot of [positive attention on Cort Johnson's blog](http://www.cortjohnson.org/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-mecfs-doctor-resource-center/dr-charles-lapp-m-d/), and seems, based on public discussions like [this one](http://simmaronresearch.com/2013/06/fda-hearing-recordings/) to be an accepted member of the CFS research and clinical community. From his [bio](http://drlapp.com/staff/dr-lapp/) you can see that he's been working with chronic fatigue illnesses since the 80's, which is as far back as any publication on the topic I've seen. 

Another big factor in choosing to see Dr. Lapp was that his office staff was genuinely helpful and welcoming on the phone when I called to inquire about an appointment. Based on my early interactions with his staff, I felt confident that the practice was patient-centered an not money-centered; which was a concern I had given the high cost of the appointments.

### Financial Barriers

It was $350 just to schedule the appointment, and ~$450 per hour for an appointment projected to take 3-4 hours. Dr. Lapp's office doesn't work directly with any insurance company, so it this cost of well over $1500 needs to come out of the patient's pocket. Some insurance companies will reimburse part of this, but with insurance companies, there's rarely a guarantee. This was of course extremely daunting, and is by far the largest downside to the appointment. Unfortunately [none of the CFS experts I've found online work with insurance companies]({% post_url 2015-12-1-Online-Resources-for-CFS-Patients %}), so at this point it's unavoidable.

### Appointment Rundown

I arrived at the office at 9am for the epic appointent, and began by taking a 30 minute long set of cognitive tests. Verbal and visual memory, attention shifting, and other cognitive constructs were measured. I waited until 10 or so and Dr. Lapp came in, clearly having studied my records in detail. He asked a ton of questions, did a thorough physical exam, then we chatted about diagnoses, treatment options, and the state of the CFS research field. This whole process took about three hours. Throughout Dr. Lapp was highly charismatic and caring, making for an effective and enjoyable rapport.

As a sidenote, he mentioned that he looks over his patients' labwork in more detail in the evening "at his leisure so that he can think about it". What an stark contrast from most of the many docs I've met who spend a total of 60s at most reviewing patient history. In the same vein he at one point lamented that a lot of docs only look for things in their specialty, something that I've seen discouragingly often.

### Q and A

Dr. Lapp and I discussed some topics that I think could be of interest to other people experiencing chronic fatigue symptoms that don't exactly fit the modern CFS criteria. I'll try to lay out these topics in a question-answer format here. Unwisely, I didn't record the coversation, so we'll have to deal with my paraphrases from memory.

**Background:** In [this post]({% post_url 2015-11-23-Diagnosing-CFS %}) I learned that the only way to confirm a CFS diagnosis is to get an opinion from an experienced clinician. As discussed in that post, I suspected that a case like mine - characterized by fatigue but not exertional malaise - would not be classified as CFS by a clinician.  
**Q:** Would you classify my case as CFS?  
**A:** (paraphrased from memory) There's definitely something going on, but it doesn't fit the CFS diagnosis.  
**Lingering Questions:** Were deviations of my case from the canonical case other than lack of exertional malaise exclusionary in Dr. Lapp's opinion?

**Background:** Dr. Lapp said that there were no other known disorders that fit my case. This is consistent with what I've found through a ton of web searching and browsing med literature.  
**Q:** Could this be an ununusal presentation of some disease?   
**A:** (paraphrasing from memory) It certainly could be, there are some occult (a.k.a. hidden) disorders that take 5-10 years to produce an identifiable presentation.  

**Q:** Is it worth it for me to painstakingly search the medical literature for rare presentations of well known diseases, in hopes of catching a potential well-known disease early?  
**A:** (paraphrasing from memory) It's very unlikely to be a fruitful search, so your time is better spent elsewhere while waiting for a clearly identifiable presentation to appear.   
**My thoughts:** I'm still tempted to be headstrong about this and continue to take time to look for rare case descriptions when reading about new diseases.

**Background:** As discussed [here]({% post_url 2015-11-23-Diagnosing-CFS %}), there's a lot of really exciting current research on CFS biomarkers, but the studies usually exclude cases that don't have exertional malaise. I'd been wondering how the results of those studies might apply to patients without exertional malaise. To address this, I think it's worth considering how CFS-like cases and canonical CFS might relate to one another.  
**Q:** Do you think there may be a relationship between a case like mine and the exertional malaise CFS currently being studied? If so, what might the relationship be?  
**A:** (paraphrasing from memory) Yes there could be a relationship. Check out theories of central sensitivity syndrome for an idea of what the relationship might be.  
**My thoughts:** This question is a very tough one, since (afaik) there's minimal data to address it.

**Backgound:** In the 90's, lack of exertional malaise was not an exclusionary criteria for CFS. Today it is. Since he's been working on the topic since those early days, Dr. Lapp is in an excellent position to explain the change.  
**Q:** Why is the CFS label now only applied to cases with PEM?  
**A:** (paraphrased from memory) It came out of discussions at a conference where the question of "how does CFS differ from depression" was vetted. PEM doesn't occur in depression, in fact the opposite occurs, so it was possible to create a clear distinction between depression and CFS if PEM was a critical criterion.  
**My thoughts:** That makes a lot of sense, and I'm glad they did it, because without the shift the recent findings of CFS biomarkers may not have been possible.

**Background:** CFS without PEM might still be biologically measurable, although we don't have data, or at least studies, on that (see last question for details).  
**Q:** Would you agree that CFS without PEM may be biologically measurable?  
**A:** (paraphrased from memory) Yes it seems possible, and it seems plausible that with the ongoing increases in CFS research, biomarkers will be found.

### Wrapping Up

In addition to the thorough background and physical exam, clinical opinion, and discussion, Dr. Lapp gave me a bunch of tips on maintaining wellness with CFS. I won't reproduce those here, since most of them can be found on his site. 

All in all, the visit was was a very useful experience which I'd recommend. Now I get to hassle with my insurance company over reimbursement for a couple of months :)
