Living with a chronic undiagnosed illness is hard. 

Feeling like you’re the only one who experiences this sort of thing is way harder, and luckily, you don’t have to.

There are a lots of us out there, and a lot of great bloggers sharing their experiences. This blog will have a slightly different focus, although the sharing of frustrating experiences with the medical industry will certainly be a fun and useful sideshow. Instead, here I’ll be focusing on my efforts to delve into the basic scientific and clinical literatures on various conditions that I might have. Along the way I’ll highlight disparities the ideas one would get in those brief encounters with doctors, and the ideas that come through when looking directly at research studies. Hopefully this blog will provide some useful pointers for other people experiencing mysterious, vague, and debilitating symptoms. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat, I’d love to hear from you. Enjoy the blog!
